It provides:
- A simple UI with a `CheckedListBox` showing available applications.
- Execution of PowerShell scripts that call `Import-EMPManagedAppData`.
- Logging to a RichTextBox (and auto-export to a log file in `%TEMP%` on exit).
- Optional file/folder copy actions **and registry imports** from a plain text definition file.

## ‚ú® Features

- **App list from file:**  
  Define available applications in `apps.txt` (one per line).  
- **Registry flagging:**  
  After a successful import, a flag is written to: HKCU\Software\AppSense\UVConfig<AppName> = 1 (DWORD)
- **Smart UI behavior:**  
- Already imported apps (detected from registry) are unchecked at startup.
- Checked items = to be imported.
- Run only selected apps, or all.

- **Logging:**  
- RichTextBox shows PowerShell stdout/stderr and copy/registry import actions.
- On application exit, the log is written to `%TEMP%\EMP_ImportLog_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.txt`.

- **File & Registry operations (copylist.txt):**  
- Copy files or folders (`source|destination`)  
- Import `.reg` files (`REGIMPORT|path-to.reg`)
