# Ivanti_PS_Profile_MigrationGUI

# Ivanti / AppSense Profile Import GUI

A small WinForms utility written in C# for automating **Ivanti / AppSense Environment Manager** profile imports.

It provides:
- A simple UI with a `CheckedListBox` showing available applications.
- Execution of PowerShell scripts that call `Import-EMPManagedAppData`.
- Logging to a RichTextBox (and auto-export to a log file in `%TEMP%` on exit).
- Optional file/folder copy actions from a plain text mapping file.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **App list from file:**  
  Define available applications in `apps.txt` (one per line).
- **Registry flagging:**  
After a successful import, a flag is written to:
HKCU\Software\AppSense\UVConfig<AppName> = 1 (DWORD)
- Already imported apps (detected from registry) are unchecked at startup.
- Checked items = to be imported.
- Run only selected apps, or all.

- **Logging:**  
- RichTextBox shows PowerShell stdout/stderr and copy actions.
- On application exit, the log is written to `%TEMP%\EMP_ImportLog_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.txt`.

- **File copy support (optional):**  
Define a `copylist.txt`
  

  
## apps.txt Example

```
# DisplayName | InternalAppName
Google Chrome | Google Chrome
Notepad++     | Notepad++ Group
7-Zip         | 7-Zip
Testpers      | Testpers Group
# single-column lines:

```
## copylist.txt Example
